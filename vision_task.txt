Project Title: Automatic Detection of Unclean Classroom Areas

Objective:
The goal of this project is to design an intelligent vision-based system that can automatically detect unclean areas in a classroom — such as litter, waste papers, bottles, or clutter — using computer vision techniques. The system aims to assist school and college maintenance teams in maintaining cleanliness more efficiently.

Problem Statement:
Classrooms often become untidy due to littering or improper waste disposal, especially in large institutions where manual inspection is difficult. Traditional cleaning schedules are time-based, not need-based, resulting in inefficiencies. An automated detection system can identify dirty spots in real-time, allowing for quicker action and cleaner environments.

Proposed Methodology:
1. Use YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for object detection and segmentation.
2. Train or fine-tune the model to recognize waste items like paper, plastic, bottles, wrappers, etc.
3. Collect and label images/videos of classroom environments.
4. Use ffmpeg to extract frames from videos and process them with the YOLO model.
5. Visualize and analyze detected unclean areas.
6. Optionally, integrate an alert system that notifies cleaning staff when an unclean area is detected.

Input:
- Video footage or images of classrooms captured via CCTV or mobile camera.

Output:
- Processed images/videos highlighting detected litter or waste using bounding boxes and colored masks.

Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- ffmpeg
- GitHub for version control and documentation

Expected Outcome:
A computer vision system capable of automatically identifying unclean classroom areas with high accuracy, enabling data-driven and efficient cleaning schedules in educational institutions.

Future Scope:
- Extend to corridors, canteens, and public spaces.
- Integrate with IoT devices for automatic alerts.
- Apply transfer learning to improve detection accuracy for specific types of waste.
